1. Export data as CSV from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
	* Confirmed Cases (csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv)
	* Number of Deaths (csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv)
    * Number of Recoverys (csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv)

2. Extract them into covid_data/data_downloads/

3. Reshape Data
   Open the CMD and run the following commands (one after another):
	```
	...\scripts>python3 data_transform.py --variable confirmed
    ...\scripts>python3 data_transform.py --variable deaths
    ...\scripts>python3 data_transform.py --variable recovered
	```
4. Create SQLite Database
   Open the CMD and run the following commands (one after another):
    	```
	...\scripts>python3 covid_importer.py --column confirmed
    ...\scripts>python3 covid_importer.py --column deaths
    ...\scripts>python3 covid_importer.py --column recovered
	```

5. An SQLite data.db file is created in /sqlite/
